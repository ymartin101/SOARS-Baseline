Utilities provided with SOARS
----------------------------

These utilities are little programs that may make working with SOARS easier. They are very simple, and were written for very particular purposes, so may not do what you want them to. They do demonstrate, however, some ways in which SOARS can be aided by utility programs

cluttergen - Generate a 1d line of randomly spread clutter
cluttergen2d - Generate a 2d field of randomly spread clutter
csv2antenna - Turn a comma seperated values file of antenna gain readings into an XML file for SOARS (see also antennatool)
h52raw - Change a SOARS output file into a raw binary format. This is currently designed for using SOARS with the G2 SAR processor.
